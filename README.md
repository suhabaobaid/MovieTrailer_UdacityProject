- To install Python follow the link: https://www.python.org/downloads/ , select Python 2.7.* and download the installer according to your OS

# Running The Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the terminal/CommandLine (Mac/Windows)
3. Navigate to the project's directoy
4. Run the command
```
python entertainment_center.py
```

# Files Generated Upon Running The Code
1. `.pyc` files are byte code files generated by python for speed-up purposes of imported modules. You can read more about it in these links: http://effbot.org/pyfaq/how-do-i-create-a-pyc-file.htm , http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pytut/CompiledPythonfiles.html
2. `fresh_tomatoes.html` which is the generated file by calling the main function in fresh_tomateos.py . You can view the Movie site by opening it in any browser (doubl clicking the file would do).
